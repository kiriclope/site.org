#+TITLE: My personal setup

* General setup

I like Thinkpads. Nowadays I use a [[https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx/ThinkPad-X13-(Intel)-/22TPX13X3N1][Thinkpad X13]].
Until July 2021, I used a 12" [[https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x230][Thinkpad X230]] from 2012.

- A quite fresh [[https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed][openSUSE Tumbleweed]] as operating system/distro
- Lately, I install user software using [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] on top of Linux, instead of relying mostly on my distro packages. It allows to share installations across users while still allowing per-user profiles and  versions. When using different users for private/work, this works very well.
- [[https://www.gnome.org][GNOME]] as desktop environment, no customization.
- [[https://github.com/dmacvicar/dotfiles][dotfiles]] managed with git and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow][GNU Stow]].
- +[[https://syncthing.net][Syncthing]] to Peer-to-Peer sync some files across different devices+
  Not used much anymore since [[https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-lite][Syncthing Lite]] was deprecated and stopped working on Mobile. Moved most syncthing to Nextcloud.
- Passwords managed with [[https://keepassxc.org][KeePassXC]] (synced with Nextcloud)
- [[https://www.yubico.com/products][Yubikey]] device and [[https://developers.yubico.com/OATH][yubikey-oath]] for 2FA on Desktop and mobile
- [[https://www.mozilla.org/exp/firefox/new][Firefox]] as Web browser, with some extensions
  - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers][Multi-Account Containers]] to isolate websites
  - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container][Facebook Container]] to isolate this particular website
  - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser][KeePassXC extension]] (to integrate with password manager)
  - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin][uBlock Origin]] (Ad blocker)
- [[https://nextcloud.com][NextCloud]] to host shared files
- [[https://nextcloud.com/clients][NextCloud clients]] to sync files with NextCloud on desktop and mobile
- [[https://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] ("Your life in text mode") on top of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] to organize notes, journals and information. It also powers this website.
  - Synced with Nextcloud
  - [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orgzly][Orgzly]] as TODO widget on Android
  - [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madlonkay.orgro][Orgro]] as Org file viewer on Android
- [[http://www.tarsnap.com][tarsnap]] for backups
- [[https://restic.net/][restic]] for backups

You can also read some details about the setup for my [[file:music.org][music hobby activities]].

I also have a small Home "Lab"
  - +3 Raspberry Pi 3/4 running openSUSE Leap 15.2 and [k3s](https://k3s.io/)+
  - Lenovo ThinkCentre M910q Tiny running Arch Linux
    - [[https://www.home-assistant.io/][HomeAssistant]]
  - 1 [[https://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64][Pine64]] running +OpenBSD 6.7+ NetBSD 9.2
    - dnsmasq
  - 1 [[https://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64][Pine64]] running FreeBSD 13.2
    - dnsmasq
  - All managed with +[[https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/index.html][salt-ssh]]+ [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html][ansible]]

* Work

- [[http://isync.sourceforge.net][mbsync]] to synchronize IMAP locally
- [[https://marlam.de/msmtp][msmtp]] to send email
- [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu][mu (maildir-utils)]] as mail indexer/search
- [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] on top of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] as mail front-end/composer
- plugins/utilities
  - [[https://melpa.org/#/outlook][outlook package]] to reply HTML email

This setup is kept in an internal dotfiles repository.

*** Other
- [[https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive][unofficial onedrive client]] to sync files to OneDrive
- [[https://www.jabra.com.de/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series/jabra-speak-510][Jabra  Speak 510+]] and [[https://www.bose.com/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/noise-cancelling-headphones-700.html][Bose 700]] noise cancelling headphones for a great confcall experience

* Development environment

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] as editor for most languages, with [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmacvicar/dotfiles/master/emacs/.emacs.d/init.el][many]] extensions. Some highlights:
  - Packages managed by [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][elpaca]]
  - [[https://melpa.org/#/lsp-mode][LSP mode]] to take advantage of all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol][LSP]] servers out there
  - [[https://magit.vc][Magit]] as a git front-end
- [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki][tmux]] to manage my consoles and to split the screen in my favourite layout (editor left side, two command lines right side)
- Given my open-source background, I have to dig in code written in
  many languages. My go-to languages are C++, Golang and +Ruby+ Python depending on the task.

*** C++
- [[https://cmake.org][CMake]] as build system and to fetch dependencies
- [[https://clang.llvm.org/][clang]] provides most of the features to lsp-mode in Emacs
*** Ruby
- I use the distribution interpreter and [[https://bundler.io][bundler]] to vendor dependencies inside the project
- I use the [[https://solargraph.org][Solargraph]] gem to power lsp-mode in emacs
*** Golang
- I just use the standard Go modules
- [[https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls][gopls]] to power lsp-mode in emacs
